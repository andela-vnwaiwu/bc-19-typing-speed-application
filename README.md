# BC-19-typing speed application

An application that checks a user's typing speed by giving them a paragraph to type and checks for the speed when the user clicks the submit button. The application is written using javascript, HTML and CSS. The unit tests can be found in the 'spec' folder. The tests were written using mocha and chai.

Functions
1. As a user, I can go to the application to test my typing speed.

2. As a user, when I click on a button, I am given a paragraph which I am supposed to type. Once I submit, the application calculates my typing speed.

3. As a user, I can see a leaderboard.

I also used firebase to persist data (as a datastore).
